Steps:

1) First check that idlj compiler is installed or not(type idlj -h in command prompt).
if you do not have then install java 10 or lesser version.

2) Now that we have idlj compiler we need a file to compile,
Create a .idl file.(A CORBA interface).
Ex.
module App{
interface AppInt{
//other methods.
oneway shutdown();
}
}

3) Compile the .idl file.
Open cmd(Command prompt) > change the directory to where the .idl file is.
type idlj -fall fileName.idl

--It will generate a package(folder) with 6 .java files. Look them to get the flow.--

4) Create a class to implement all the server methods.
Create a class and extend it to the [fileName]POA.java file from the package.
Implement all the methods.
In this class declare and initialize a private data member of type ORB.
Ex.
private ORB orb;
and provide a setter method for it.

5) Create a ServerDriver class.
write main method and write following.
/*Write everything in a try catch.*/

/*this is common for all server objects*/
ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null);
POA rootpoa = POAHelper.narrow(orb.resolve_initial_references("RootPOA"));
rootpoa.the_POAManager().activate();


Create as many server object as you want.

set the ORB object with created servers with setter method defined previously.

/*Create a reference for all the servers as follows*/

org.omg.CORBA.Object AppIntRef = rootpoa.servant_to_reference(serverObj);

/*create a hyper reference for all the servers as follows*/

AppInt AppIntHRef = AppIntHelper.narrow(AppIntRef);

/*this is common for all server objects*/
Object objRef =  orb.resolve_initial_references("NameService");
NamingContextExt ncRef = NamingContextExtHelper.narrow(objRef);


/*create name paths and bind all the server objects.*/
for each server object write following,

NameComponent[] objPath = ncRef.to_name("Name");
ncRef.rebind(objPath, AppIntHref);

at the end add a true while loop for constantly listening client request.
while(true){orb.run();}

6) To run the server on a port we need to pass arguments to main function of ServerDriver class
---IntelliJ---
Go to Run > Edit Configuration > select the ServerDriver class from left pane,
At the program argument section write following,
-ORBInitialPort 1304 -ORBInitialHost localhost

------We are done with Server configuration------
/**To test server
*  open a command prompt
*  Type:
*  start orbd -ORBInitialPort 1304
*  And Run the ServerDriver class.
